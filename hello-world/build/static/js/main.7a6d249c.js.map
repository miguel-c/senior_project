A team may protest illegal players at any time [e.g. players on more than one team in the same division (division meaning gender -- men\\'s, women\\'s, co-ed); players not on the official roster; etc.].  If you suspect a team of having illegal players you can e-mail us and we will investigate the matter; please do not abuse this procedure -- you must have a legitimate reason to believe a player to be \\'illegal\\'.',\n\t                                                                                                React.createElement('br', null),\n\t                                                                                                React.createElement(\n\t                                                                                                                'a',\n\t                                                                                                                { href: '#list' },\n\t                                                                                                                'Back to Top'\n\t                                                                                                )\n\t                                                                                ),\n\t                                                                                React.createElement('br', null),\n\t                                                                                React.createElement(\n\t                                                                                                'p',\n\t                                                                                                { id: 'jobs' },\n\t                                                                                                React.createElement(\n\t                                                                                                                'big',\n\t                                                                                                                null,\n\t                                                                                                                React.createElement(\n\t                                                                                                                                'b',\n\t                                                                                                                                null,\n\t                                                                                                                                'Are there jobs available?'\n\t                                                                                                                )\n\t                                                                                                ),\n\t                                                                                                React.createElement('br', null),\n\t                                                                                                'Of course.

It's where students, faculty, and staff can\r\n                  form teams in various sports and compete against one another internally.  Some intramural sports offer an opportunity to play other\r\n                  schools which is referred to as extramurals.  Villanova University belongs to CITY 6 where they compete against other schools in\r\n                  Philadelphia.  VU also belongs to the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA) which organizes several extramural\r\n                  and intramural events.\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  <a href=\"#list\">Back to Top</a>\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <br></br>\r\n                <p id=\"sports\">\r\n                  <big><b>What sports are offered at Villanova?</b></big>\r\n\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  Villanova University offers several team-sport seasons in the fall and spring semesters.\r\n                  They also offer tournaments both in the fall and spring.

Teams are formed in several ways: dorm floors, campus organizations, Greek organization, friends, etc.\r\n\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  <a href=\"#list\">Back to Top</a>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br></br>\r\n\r\n                <p id=\"register\">\r\n\r\n                  <big><b>How do I register a team?</b></big>\r\n\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  To register a team, you can download a Team Roster form, or pick one up from the Intramural Office located in the Davis Center for\r\n                  Athletics and Fitness or from the Intramural bulletin board in the basement of the Jake Nevin Field House.  Each participant must\r\n                  complete a Waiver before they are permitted to participate.  PLEASE note the dates that the entry forms are being collected.\r\n                  Captains: Allow enough time for your teammates to return waivers to you.  A team MUST submit all team members' waivers and the forfeit\r\n                  fee upon registration.\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  <a href=\"#list\">Back to Top</a>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br></br>\r\n\r\n                <p id=\"forfeit\">\r\n\r\n                  <big><b>What's the deal with the forfeit fee?</b></big>\r\n\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  The forfeit fee ensures that your team will show up to all the assigned games.  The fees vary by sport/activity and are listed on the\r\n                  Fall Sports and Spring Sports pages next to each sport/activity.  If you attend the captain's meeting and all your games, than your\r\n                  fee will be refunded during a refunding period after the end of the season/tournament.  An e-mail will be sent to the captain if they\r\n                  are eligible for a refund regarding the dates and times he/she can pick it up.  If you know in advance that your team cannot field the\r\n                  minimum amount of participants than you can contact the Intramural Office about the cancellation by 5:00PM of the business day prior to\r\n                  the event, in order to save your forfeit fee.  If a team decides to forfeit the entire season or tournament, you will lose your fee\r\n                  regardless of notice given.\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  <a href=\"#list\">Back to Top</a>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br></br>\r\n\r\n                <p id=\"player\">\r\n\r\n                  <big><b>Can we add a player to our team?</b></big>\r\n\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  Yes.

Waivers can be dropped off at the front desk on the 3rd floor of the Davis Center.\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  <a href=\"#list\">Back to Top</a>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br></br>\r\n\r\n                <p id=\"protest\">\r\n\r\n                  <big><b>How can I protest my game?</b></big>\r\n\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  If either team does not agree with a call, the captain, and only the captain (or acting captain if captain is not present) can approach\r\n                  the official(s) for an explanation.  A rule can be overturned after this time.  If this caucus takes up a generous amount of time, the\r\n                  game clock may be stopped for further discussion.  Protests of an entire contest based on rules or calls must be made before the teams leave\r\n                  the field of the contest.  The formal protest will be settled at that time by the supervisor on duty.  A team may protest illegal players at\r\n                  any time [e.g. players on more than one team in the same division (division meaning gender -- men's, women's, co-ed); players not on the\r\n                  official roster; etc.].  If you suspect a team of having illegal players you can e-mail us and we will investigate the matter; please do not\r\n                  abuse this procedure -- you must have a legitimate reason to believe a player to be 'illegal'.\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  <a href=\"#list\">Back to Top</a>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <br></br>\r\n\r\n                <p id=\"jobs\">\r\n\r\n                  <big><b>Are there jobs available?</b></big>\r\n\r\n                  <br></br>\r\n                  Of course.

A team may protest illegal players at any\r\n                        time [e.g. players on more than one team in the same division (division meaning gender -- men's, women's, co-ed); players not on the official\r\n                        roster; etc.].  If you suspect a team of having illegal players you can e-mail lisa.harris@villanova.edu and we will investigate the matter;\r\n                        please do not abuse this procedure -- you must have a legitimate reason to believe a player to be 'illegal'.\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        No team is guaranteed entry into playoffs.  Teams will be eliminated from playoffs if they forfeit any game during the season or if their sportsmanship\r\n                        average is below a 3.0.   After that, teams may be eliminated based on winning percentage. <b> TEAMS MUST EARN A 3.0+ IN ALL PLAYOFF GAMES TO STAY IN.</b>\r\n                      </li>\r\n                      <li>\r\n                        Captains (or a team rep) must attend the captains meeting at the beginning of each season.
